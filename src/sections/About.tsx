          I recently graduated from the University of Central Florida with a
          Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science with Magna Cum Laude honors
          and now pursuing a Master&apos;s degree in Computer Science at the
          same university.

          I have a strong passion for software engineering, artificial
          intelligence, and machine learning and always have a user-centric
          approach to my work. My various experiences, coursework, and projects
          in team settings have allowed me to develop my skills in
          collaboration, communication, and problem-solving.
